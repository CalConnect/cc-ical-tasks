|  | STATUS   | PARTSTAT  | Action

| 1 | - |  - | Organizer draft
| 2 | NEEDS-ACTION  | NEEDS-ACTION  | Organizer sends iTIP "REQUEST"
| 3 | NEEDS-ACTION  | ACCEPTED        | Attendee "REPLY"
| 4 | PENDING       | ACCEPTED        | Task accepted but waiting on some "trigger" to start (e.g. another task has to finish first)
| 5 | IN-PROCESS    | IN-PROCESS      | Attendee "REPLY" now working on the task
| 6 | IN-PROCESS    | COMPLETED       | Attendee "REPLY" completed
| 7 | COMPLETED     | COMPLETED       | Overall state set - either by
Organizer for TASK-MODE=CLIENT or by server for AUTOMATIC-COMPLETION

=== Example for multiple Attendees

Example of status changes in assigning and performing a task with two attendees (A1 and A2).

.Example for multiple Attendees
[cols="1,3,3,3,10",options=header]
|===
| | STATUS | PARTSTAT (A1) | PARTSTAT (A2) | Action

| 1 | - |  -  | - | Organizer draft.
| 2 | NEEDS-ACTION | NEEDS-ACTION  | NEEDS-ACTION | Organizer sends iTIP "REQUEST".
| 4 | NEEDS-ACTION  |  ACCEPTED   |     NEEDS-ACTION | Attendee 1 "REPLY".
| 5 | NEEDS-ACTION  | ACCEPTED      |  ACCEPTED  | Attendee 2 "REPLY".
| 6 |  PENDING  |  ACCEPTED      |  ACCEPTED    | Task accepted but waiting on some"trigger" to start (e.g. another task has to finish first)
| 7 | IN-PROCESS |  ACCEPTED   |     IN-PROCESS | Attendee 2 "REPLY" now working on the task.
| 8 | IN-PROCESS |  IN-PROCESS |     IN-PROCESS| Attendee 1 "REPLY" now working on the task.
| 9 | IN-PROCESS    |  COMPLETED  |     IN-PROCESS| Attendee 1 "REPLY" Completed (overall status still IN-PROCESS).
| 10 | IN-PROCESS    |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED | Attendee 2 "REPLY" Completed
| 11 |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED     |  COMPLETED | Overall state set once both attendees are finished. May be set by Organizer for TASK-MODE=CLIENT or by server for AUTOMATIC-COMPLETION

NOTE: The logic for determining the status change to the "VTODO" calendar component
is determined by the task organizer based on the "ATTENDEE" property status and other business logic.

=== Example of Failure

Example of status changes for a task that fails.

.Example of Failure

|===
| | STATUS  | PARTSTAT | Action

| 1 |  - | - | Organizer draft
| 2 |  NEEDS-ACTION   |     NEEDS-ACTION | Organizer sends iTIP "REQUEST"
| 3| NEEDS-ACTION  |  ACCEPTED  | Attendee "REPLY"
| 4| IN-PROCESS | IN-PROCESS | Attendee "REPLY" now working on the task
| 5| IN-PROCESS | FAILED  | Attendee "REPLY" task failed
| 6| FAILED | FAILED  | Overall state set by Organizer for TASK-MODE=CLIENT or by server for AUTOMATIC-FAILURE
