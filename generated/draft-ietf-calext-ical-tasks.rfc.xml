<t anchor="_b5b55fe9-a51e-3cd8-50e2-eaf01dbf8858">This document specifies extensions to the existing Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref>, and associated protocols, in order to enhance the structured communication and execution of tasks. The enhancements allow for the communication, time planning and scheduling of tasks by and between automated systems (e.g. taxi dispatch systems, in smart power grids, business process management systems) as well as for human centered tasks.</t>

<t anchor="_661d834c-cd2d-1845-81bd-5378fdcb0bee">A "task" is a representation of an item of work assigned to an individual or organization. In the iCalendar Object Model <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> the representation of tasks is by "VTODO" calendar components. Tasks can be identified in a number of situations, either informally as ad-hoc tasks in personal "to-do" lists or more formally in: Business processes - ranging from repetitive workflows to adaptive cases and trouble ticketing Project Management - whether for large scale construction projects or collaborative software development</t>

<t anchor="_54e7ad4b-5980-724f-8001-8a37373a7420">The extensions specified in this document enhance and standardize the following:</t>

<dl anchor="_ac3d285d-4e20-b472-3245-22b37ef8f212"><dt>The specification of tasks</dt><dd><t anchor="_fdf6169b-f385-0a0b-02d3-102281acc094">how a task type is defined and the relationships between tasks See <xref target="task-specification"></xref>.</t>

</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_cc85945b-3a80-5ee8-8a90-ba4461afbddf">These extensions are defined within the context of an overall architecture for task calendaring and scheduling, which elaborates that supported by <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> and related standards.</t>

<section anchor="conventions"><name>Terms and Definitions</name>

<t anchor="_2e835703-5dbc-1609-2be1-14ab8cc3772e">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14  <xref target="RFC2119" section="" relative=""></xref> <xref target="RFC8174" section="" relative=""></xref> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t anchor="_9d0c0c24-5d55-cec1-f6d5-a26ebc088858">Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper case.  For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" (CU) within the scheduling protocol.</t>

<t anchor="_03ce87db-5a71-c4f8-4136-e59a02c17678">Calendar components defined by <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> and updating specifications are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the words "calendar component".  For example, "VEVENT" calendar component refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO" calendar component refers to the to-do calendar component, and "VJOURNAL" calendar component refers to the daily journal calendar component.</t>

<t anchor="_7f7a5633-5c1a-bb78-efe0-44b28a08a223">Scheduling methods are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text.  For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified; "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.</t>

<t anchor="_3973f1a4-b762-c728-8637-49e0c32cc4dc">Properties defined by <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> and updating specifications are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".

    <section anchor="architecture"><name>Task Architecture</name>

<t anchor="_e0825f67-031d-113a-47fe-0ab1991127f0">A reference architecture for task calendaring and scheduling is defined in order to identify the key logical elements involved in task management and the interfaces between them to enable interoperability. Central to this architecture is the Calendar and Scheduling System. The logical elements identified here establish an appropriate separation of concerns and clarify the responsibilities of different elements. However, the architecture does not prescribe a binding or packaging of elements, i.e., software systems may be developed where some elements are tightly bound and the interfaces between bound elements are not exposed. The task architecture is also described in  <xref target="TARCH" section="" relative=""></xref>.</t>

<t anchor="_7718d235-1d3c-94e5-669d-68e83fe77d8a">The following logical elements form the task architecture that this specification is based on:</t>

<dl anchor="_44b8f280-0be6-0d52-ae51-e88315240cc4"><dt>Task Actors</dt><dd><t anchor="_a9df46e0-908f-fd5c-3602-74cbc7b4c5b9">Various calendar users that may be involved in the monitoring or performing of a task. The set of actors includes: Organizers, Observers, Resources, Assignees, and Candidates.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Organizer</dt><dd><t anchor="_ce6eda01-697d-f143-5363-ff3d994d0671">The creator of a task, who also determines task assignment and scheduling, and monitors task progress.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Domain Data</dt><dd><t anchor="_bc62c71c-15ff-0a63-08bf-15f6151cef43">This is any domain specific data that may be acted on or provides context to it in performing a task.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Specific Application</dt><dd><t anchor="_b6f2bbaa-94de-7070-a33f-c2c3f06e6fc8">A task specific application renders the data concerning the task (including task domain data) for presentation and manipulation by a task actor.</t>
</dd><dt>Process Logic</dt><dd><t anchor="_58226eaa-39fe-8d26-0269-9cb3c9496374">Determines under what conditions a task (or tasks) is generated and the actions to take on completion, or some other status event occurring (or not) on the task.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Trigger</dt><dd><t anchor="_5d1a5a10-3e82-41d3-8ac8-028fb12684cb">This is some event that gives rise to the generation of a task according to Process Logic. Task triggers can come from many sources including, for example; a task being requested through the calendaring system, a status change in the progression of a business process being managed by a business process management or Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Assignment Rules</dt><dd><t anchor="_aad1a35f-6e8b-92b4-d0a2-af968413e892">Govern how actors are assigned to a task. A range of different assignment patterns  <xref target="WfRP" section="" relative=""></xref> may be considered, including the two general cases:</t>
<ol anchor="_d3e936cf-1465-e25b-e062-e375bdb592cd" type="a"><li anchor="_0f0d3d98-6a20-41d8-9be4-d26037848cbf">Delegation to a named actor or group of actors</li>
<li anchor="_46204cc2-b54c-448c-b55c-6870d307acd0">Advertising to a pool of actors for self-selection</li>
</ol>

<t anchor="_0aab3697-351a-1ba4-f745-470bc42ffec0">In either case the assignment may be made based on a variety of criteria including, name, availability, skills, capacity, etc.</t>
</dd><dt>Task Generating System</dt><dd><t anchor="_16645c46-a475-a884-3bed-0ae73567905c">A system that creates and assigns tasks in response to some initiating event (task trigger). Task creation is according to Process Logic with task assignment determined by Task Assignment Rules. This system also tracks the status of tasks and will initiate further actions based upon the status. A task generating system can take many forms, for example; Business Process Management System, Project Management System, Bug Tracking System, Building Control System. A Task Generating System may also be a human. In iCalendar terms the Task Generating System is the organizer.</t>
<t anchor="_69c9e14d-8ae5-2b4e-ad21-b7c1e301be56">Task creation, assignment and tracking coordinated by a human organizer is a special case of a task generating system. In this case Task Assignment Rules and Process Logic may be either explicit or tacit.</t>
</dd><dt>Calendar and Scheduling System</dt><dd><t anchor="_638687f0-1cc6-c25c-5704-e51100eb22f1">A software system that stores, publishes and synchronizes calendar data such as events, tasks and journal entries for actors. In the context of tasks this includes schedules (i.e. allocated time and availability to perform tasks) and task lists. A calendar and scheduling system typically consists of server and client software components.</t>
</dd></dl>

<t anchor="_61b3e897-4a79-4d8e-25d9-c7f4af063e0e">It is not within the scope of this document to specify how Process Logic or Task Assignment Rules are codified. Such logic and rules may be codified in a variety of ways, including traditional programming languages (e.g. C++, Java) or process modelling languages (e.g. BPMN <xref target="BPMN" section="" relative=""></xref>).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="architecture-foundations"><name>Architecture Foundations</name>

<t anchor="_1920ec7c-05be-f3d1-4587-41c4878735eb">The key standards that enable interoperability between the logical elements of the architecture are the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)  <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> and associated protocols. Task and task status are represented by the "VTODO" calendar component. Protocols include, in particular, the iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)  <xref target="RFC5546" section="" relative=""></xref> for task assignment and scheduling, and Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)  <xref target="RFC4791" section="" relative=""></xref> for client server communication.</t>

<t anchor="_2d732aa8-8423-38e1-dd75-a50a76a5f40a">Additionally, this specification uses definitions from Support for iCalendar Relationships  <xref target="RFC9253" section="" relative=""></xref>. The "LINK", "REFID", "RELATED-TO" and "CONCEPT" properties enable context and a rich set of relationships between tasks and other calendar components to be specified.</t>

    <section anchor="task-extensions"><name>Task Extensions</name>

<t anchor="_33c5b397-1362-c703-bef5-dfd758b9a3ef">In order to support the task architecture described in <xref target="architecture"></xref>, this document defines a number of extensions to iCalendar <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> in the areas of:</t>

<section anchor="_deadlines"><name>Deadlines</name>

<t anchor="_e4b9595d-dbd8-5f08-4c33-84c9e4bf96e8">Deadlines for starting and finishing a task are defined by the "DTSTART", "DUE" and "DURATION" properties. The "DTSTART" property represents the earliest start time for beginning work on a task. The "DUE", or "DTSTART" + "DURATION" properties represent the latest finish time for a task. Thus, these properties define a "window" within which a task has to be performed. However,  <xref target="RFC5545" section="" relative=""></xref> provides no way to indicate how long the task is expected to take. This document defines a new "ESTIMATED-DURATION" property, in  <xref target="prop-estimated-duration"></xref>, to allow the estimated time that a task should take to be specified separately from the deadlines for starting and finishing a task. This supports time planning by enabling calendar user agents to display when tasks should occur and therefore allow calendar users to visualize when tasks should be performed and allocate time to them.</t>

<t anchor="_5e249cbf-b084-7f8b-7a5f-a16d5e7267e1">The CalDAV <xref target="RFC4791" section="" relative=""></xref> calendar access protocol allows clients and servers to exchange iCalendar data. With the introduction of the "TASK-MODE" property in this specification, different automated task management behaviours may be delegated to the server by the Task Organizer depending upon the value of "TASK-MODE".</t>

<t anchor="_a99e3c6f-a9f1-9dd3-9326-7b19ab1e9f68">In order for a CalDAV client to know what task modes are available, a CalDAV server advertises a CALDAV:supported-task-mode-set WebDAV property on calendar home or calendar collections if it supports the use of the "TASK-MODE" property as described in this specification.  The server can advertise a specific set of supported task modes by including one or more CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML elements within the CALDAV:supported-task-mode-set XML element.</t>

<t anchor="_096ee435-9b13-996b-0123-a233a6f8046d">If no CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML elements are included in the WebDAV property, then clients MUST assume the server does not support this specification. The client MAY attempt to store iCalendar data containing "TASK-MODE" elements but needs to be prepared for a failure response from the server.</t>

<t anchor="_b93bf4e7-4bcf-c8bd-a713-6a0958cd8f09">A server supporting this specification MUST return an HTTP 403 response with a DAV:error element containing a CALDAV:supported-task-mode XML element, if a client attempts to store iCalendar data with an "TASK-MODE" element value not supported by the server.</t>

<t anchor="_d44b02ad-9fc4-6660-5271-9f1daeb22d09">It is possible for a "TASK-MODE" value to be present in calendar data on the server being accessed by a client that does not support the "TASK-MODE" property. It is expected that existing clients, unaware of "TASK-MODE", will fail gracefully by ignoring the calendar property.</t>
